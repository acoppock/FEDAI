#' Table 2.2 from FEDAI
#'
#' This hypothetical dataset shows a realized assignment (`Z`) and the corresponding revealed outcome (`Y`). Unobserved treated (`Y_Z_1`) and untreated (`Y_Z_0`) potential outcomes are marked as `NA` as is the village-level treatment effect `tau_i`.

#' Box 3.7 from FEDAI
#'
#' This hypothetical dataset has two columns, a realized treatment (`Z`) and a revealed outcome (`Y`). The purpose of the dataset is to illustrate how traditional t-tests and randomization inference can yield different answers
