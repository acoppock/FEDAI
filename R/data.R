#' Arceneaux, K. (2005). Using Cluster Randomized Field Experiments to Study Voting Behavior. The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 601(1), 169-179
#' These data are from a precinct-level randomized field experiment conducted in Kansas City, Missouri. The columns in this subset of the data include the precinct, whether the subject voted in the 2003 election (the outcome variable), whether contact was successful, and the assigned treatment status)

#' Box 3.7 from FEDAI
#'
#' This hypothetical dataset has two columns, a realized treatment (`Z`) and a revealed outcome (`Y`). The purpose of the dataset is to illustrate how traditional t-tests and randomization inference can yield different answers

#' The Effects of Race and Grammar Quality on the Responsiveness of American State Legislators: A Field Experiment,
#' Working paper, 2010.
#'
#' These data describe 400 observations of state legislators who were sent letters requesting information about immigration rules. The race of the sender was randomly manipulated through the name (Colin or Jose), as was the grammar of the letter (good or bad). The dataset records whether the request received a response and whether the legislator is themselves hispanic or not.
